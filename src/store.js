I used Bootstrap to build a grid system that would adjust to different screen sizes and allow for easy laIt of search filters and results. Additionally, I used jQuery UI to create a dropdown menu for users to select different search criteria such as make, model, year, and price range. To enhance the user experience, I implemented a live search feature that would update the search results as the user typed in their search query. To achieve this, I used React and Redux to manage the state of the search results and filter criteria. I also used Slick to create a carousel that would display images of the cars in the search results, making it easier for users to browse and select the cars they were interested in. Lastly, I used Boomerang to track user behavior and analyze website performance, enabling I to make data-driven decisions and optimizations to improve the website's functionality and user experience.",

However, one of the challenges I faced was integrating the application with third-party APIs and ensuring that all data was properly synchronized.
